You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.






// slice the first value off the string as that is the number. Then use the Number() to make sure the return is a number not a string.

function getAge(inputString){
 let num = inputString.slice(0,1)
 return Number(num)
}
